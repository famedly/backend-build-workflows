# Naming conventions

These are *all* workflows defined in this repository, including ones
only intended to run *in* this repository (to test the workflows that
*can* be used elsewhere).

Since GitHub actions do not permit creating subdirectories, or
otherwise distinguishing these two types of workflows, we use a
low-tech workaround - filenames of workflows not intended for external
use are prefixed with a tilde (`~`). This ensures that they are sorted
alphabetically last.
